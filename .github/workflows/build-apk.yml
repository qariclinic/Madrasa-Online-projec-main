    # 1. RUNNER FIX: Ensure Bash or a suitable shell is available.
    #    We use ubuntu-latest (which usually has bash) but explicitly set the default shell to sh 
    #    as a strong safeguard against the missing /usr/bin/bash error.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    shell: sh # <-- THIS IS THE CRITICAL LINE TO BYPASS THE /usr/bin/bash ERROR
